"""Test of the time rules with a stand-in for the game (records the commands the companion sends):
- whoever is behind catches up with whoever is furthest ahead; nobody is ever pushed back
- pausing is your own: a paused player isn't caught up and doesn't hold anyone back
- speed is normal while anyone's awake, fast while everyone's asleep; alone on the server, speed is yours
- season and weather follow the leader
